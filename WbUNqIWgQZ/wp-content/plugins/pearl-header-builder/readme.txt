The intuitive drag and drop editor makes it easy to build a customized header which will provide website users with a great experience on any device or platform that they are using to access the website.

## How do I install it?

To successfully install the plugin, you need to first go to the plugin tab on the WordPress main screen. From there, you need to search for Pearl Header Builder. Once you have found it, you need to click on the button to download the relevant files. 

When they have finished downloading to your computer, you need to then either upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.

Once completed, you will need to activate the plugin through the Plugins screen in WordPress. After you have done this, you can use the Header Builder to configure the plugin. Ensure you include a header builder shortcode into your theme header.

Further details on the installation process can be found in the documentation included with the download. 

## How do I use it?

Once installed, you will be able to access the plugin from the main admin menu. The six primary tabs included here are ‘header options,’ ‘header builder,’ ‘top bar,’ ‘main header,’ ‘bottom bar,’ and ‘import header.’ 

In the header options section, there are facilities for selecting the website’s logo, specifying the width of the header container and content as well as a feature for choosing the sticky part of the header (top, main, or bottom). A sticky header, also known as a fixed header, is one that is always at the top of a screen even as the user scrolls down the page. 

Additionally, in this area you will be choosing the header colors including the main color, secondary color, third color and background color. You also have the option of adding a header background image. Further to this, you can add in all the links to any social networks that you wish to display here under the’ header socials’ section of the page. 

The header builder tab takes you to the central part of the plugin, where you will be adding in the header elements. The builder divides the header into three main parts: top, main, and bottom. If you click on the plus icons, you will be able to see the selection of elements available to add. These include text, images, buttons, socials, popups, and sign in, among other things. 

As you might expect, the next three tabs enable you to customize these specific parts of the headers. Included here are options on padding – which is the space between the contents of a box and its border, background color or image, text colors, and link hover colors.  As previously covered, the builder supports drag and drop capabilities, so you can easily move around the different elements within your header.

Finally, under import header, you have the option of importing header templates. Here you will find twelve pre-designed options that include pre-built heading structures. In order to import one of these, you simply click on the preferred template image and then on the ‘import header’ button. The page will be refreshed, and you will be able to view the header under the ‘header to edit’ drop-down menu. 

After either creating or selecting a header, you simply copy one of the codes and insert it into the header.php file of your theme.

How do my customers use it?
